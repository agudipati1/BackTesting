a.13- added dg-rating>70 screener
a.14- added base-number<4 screener
a.15- removed base-num logic and using base-stage<4 instead.
a.16<bad> - added secondary signals logic 
a.17<bad>- added comp-rating>70 screener
a.18<bad>- adjusted secondary signals logic - using only 20ema now for secondary-position-buys
	- 10ema is used for secondary-signals only if it is within pivot-area
a.19- introduced hard and soft stop loss
	- hard-stop-loss of -7%, 
	- soft-stop-loss of -5% only triggers if price is not at MA-support
a.20- fixed PR breakout day check to use pivot-price-day as opposed to breakout-day to check buy range

a.25- increased secondary buy point to 5% of total position gains (previously 2.5)
a.26- added scaled stop loss (2.5% / 5% of cost-basis) for positions with multiple buy transactions
a.27- added scaled stop loss (1% / 3% of cost-basis) for positions with multiple buy transactions

a.29- added watchlists to alpha model- permanently removed secondary signals.
a.30- <bad logic> dont buy from watchlists if symbols undercut low of the breakout-day
    - remove from watchlist the bases that are previously added to process signal
a.31- fixed a.30 logic bug 
    - market-downtrend/cautious-uptrend sells trigger only if the stock is down on that day.
    - secondary-buy point: added 10ema and 50ma (previously only 20ema) breakouts. changed to 2.5% from ma (prevously 4%)
a.32- changed market-cautious-uptrend buys to have max-num-of-positions limit to (maxlimit/2 + 1) [previously it was maxlmit/2)
    - fixed an issue a.31 with secondary-buy-point
a.33- changed max-positions limit  to 6 (previously 5)
a.34- added selling of underperformers (bad logic never triggered this feature)
    - BUYS: changed max positions in downtrend to TWO (previoulsy ZERO) - this is same logic as what was in previous logic for market-cautiousuptrend.
    - BUYS: in market-cautious-uptrend is changed to be same as in uptrend
a.35- Secondary BUYS - Uses breaking up above 10ema only if market is in uptrend (previously both uptrend and cautious-uptrend)

a.37- adusted selling underperformers logic (days since <15d then %chg>0, <30d %chg>2, <45d %chg>4, <60d %chg>6, <75d %chg>8, >90d %chg > 10) (previously check a.36)
    - fixed a bug with selling underperformers logic (in a.36)
a.38- fixed an issue with alpha model not picking up IPO stocks [GPRO-2014]
    - secondary buys are done even in downtrend (previously only uptrend/cautious-uptrend) [EMES-2014]
    - fixed a seconday-buy logic issue when using 10ema
    - sells in downtrend checks 20ema only if position-pct-chg < 10% [QIHU-6/21/13]
a.39- changed alpha screening threshold for DG/Comp-Rating to <60 (previously <70) 
a.40<bad>- adusted selling underperformers logic - missing 75-90d perf threshold (days since <5d ignore,<10d %chg>0, <20d %chg>1.5, <40d %chg>3, <60d %chg>5, <75d %chg>7.5, >75d %chg > 10) (previously check a.37) [SBUX-2015]
a.41- re-adusted selling underperformers logic - missing 75-90d perf threshold (days since <5d ignore,<10d %chg>0, <20d %chg>1.5, <40d %chg>3, <60d %chg>5, <75d %chg>6, >75d %chg > 7.5) (previously check a.40) [finally fixes the SBUX-2015]

a.44- changed watchlists process-days back to 15 (previously 10)
a.45/46- re-adusted selling underperformers logic - (days since <10d ignore, <15d then %chg>0, <30d %chg>2, <45d %chg>4, <60d %chg>6, <75d %chg>8, >90d %chg>10, <100d %chg>12, <120d>14, >=120 %chg>15) (previously check a.42) [fixes selling AMBA-May-2015]
a.47- 10 positions, underperformance logic simplified (<10d ignore, >=10d then %chg>0)
a.48- back to 5 positions (undid a.47)
    - if closing-range<40 then added to watchlists instead of ignoring it (previously clsrng<50 was ignore)

a.50- increased secondary buy thresoholds to 7% overall and 5% since last buy (previously 5% overall and 2.5% since last buy)
a.51- decreased secondary buy BACK to prev thresoholds to 5% overall and 2.5% since last buy (previously see a.50)
    - also added checks to 10EMA secondary buys to have min %chg of 9.5%, 20EMA to be 7.0% and 50ma  buys to be 4.5% (this avoid secondary sells as a result of AMBA,SCI and SBUX on pullbacks)
a.52- MarketTimingSells: Uptrend and daysFromLatestTx >= 5 and <2% of 20ema and overall position-pctchg < 1% then sell it [AMBA-4/2015]
a.53- Alpha: breakout must be a gap-day for recent-new-highs to qualify [this ignores IPAR buy on 5/12/2015 (base is still in construction as of now) ]
    - breakoutday %chg should be > 5% (previously >=5% or gapup)
    - sells in downtrend checks 20ema only if position-pct-chg < 1.5% [AMBA-5/8/2015] - see a.38 for corresponding change
    - <bad> underperformance sell: checks if position has 20ema support or is above 20ema before selling due to underperformance [SBUX-5/5/2015]
a.54- underperformance sell adjustment: added 0.5% increments starting from 0% @ 15d for every additional 5d from first-date [SBUX-5/1/2015]

a.56- fixed a bug in a.53 logic for underperformance sell (to be considered underperformance price is not at support/breakaway from 20ema and not above 20ema)
    - removed a.30 check for currentday-close lower than breakoutday-low for watchlists (due to coding complexities)
a.57- added unprocessed signals back to watchlist.
a.58- temporarily changed max # of positions to 6
a.59/60- added marketuptrend sell logic to sell if price <= -2% of 50dma and on a red-day [TSLA shouldve been sold on 11/6/2015 instead of 10/23/2015]
    - fixed a bug with gap-up logic (affects all previous gap-up alpha model logics) [NSM-Jan-2015 breakout not recoginized as valid gapup]
    - added additonal checks to ignore ETF/ETN/REIT [NRZ being incorrectly recognized as a stock on 2015-Feb]
a.61/62- rebalances purchase-amts every 10% realized-gain/loss 
a.63- unprocessed symbols are put back into proper watchlist bucket to prevent them from continually coming up into watclist when sent back as unprocessed signals [LOCK kept going back to watclist from 10/30/2013 breakout till Jan-2014]
    - added 0.25 threshold when adjustedRealizedPctGains goes 1 pct-point lower than previous one. To prevent frequent rebalancing.
a.64- alpha model doesnt consider signals on merger news.
    - changed definition of recent IPO <365d (previously <75d) [EMES-Mar-2014 breakout not being recognized as a good base]
    - also fixed gap-ups to correctly identify for recent IPOs (fixes to use rolling-atr when ATR is null) [EMES-March-2014]
    - gives more weightage to recent IPOs (IPO<6m 120points, IPO<3m 140points)
    - removed checks for comp-rating - it was NEVER populated in all previous runs 
a.65- WatchLists: added back the logic to check if base is below the breakout-day low (removed in a.56). 
    - the change also checks to make sure it is in buyable zone from pivot-price [AMBA in watchlist on March-2015 wa]
    - added take-over 'TO' corp-events as merger-event (ignores them) [FMI Jan-12-2015]
a.66- Changed numOfPositionsOpenToBuy logic to use as much cash available as possible in uptrend.
	Uptrend: uses 200% available cash, CAUTIOUS-UPTREND: uses 100%, and DOWNTREND: 50% (concept of margin not explicity coded yet but it is essesntialy supported indirectly)
a.67- slight adjustment to underperformance logic - doesnot sell if position is > -0.5% of 20ema [SBUX Apr-17-2015]
a.68- market-timing: uptrend sells check 20ema if position-pct-chg < 2% (previously 1.5%) - see a.38 & a.53 for corresponding change
    - added market-timing: cautious-uptrend sell check 20ema if position-pct-chg < 1.5%
    - all market-timing sells are done only on red-days
a.69- OTC symbols are ignored [VWDRY-Jan-2014]
    - Fixed the avg-volume check (bug introduced when IPO checks were being added)
a.70- Alpha: decreased market-cap to 750M (previously 1B) [YY-2014]
    - Alpha: Breakout vol must be at least 150%, breakout pct-chg must be atleast 5.5% [this was done to avoid some bad breakouts in early 2014]
a.71- Alpha: Breakout must be to new-highs (previously new-highs or new-recent-highs + gapup - this was done to avoid bad breakouts in 2014)
a.72- Alpha: Testing breakouts signal with both new-highs and gapup (a.71 resulted in great results overall but mediocre in 2014 )
a.73- Alpha: undid a.72 (removed gaps to new-highs - results were good - much less drawdown but less overall growth too)
    - Alpha: removed the EPS ranking check for stocks > 4yrs after IPO (seems like data is not reliable in historydb)
a.74- fixed a bug with calculation of num-of-positions to buy logic 
a.75- added weak signal concept for 2008/2009 period where stock were breaking out but not at new-highs. all non-new-high breakouts are considered weak-signals for now.
a.76- fixed a bug with historical data missing in stock-header coming from historical db (uses price-vol data when missing)
    - fixed the logic in a.75 which made the watchlists signals as weak-signals. Changed to strong-signals for all watchlists signals. [AMBA-Mar-2015]
a.77- only strong signals are added to watchlist
a.78/79- StopLoss using SoftStop-Sell: Added logic to make sure stop is above -0.5% from 20ema to be considered for soft-stoploss-sell [PLT-2/4/2013]
    - minor bug fix where 20ema & 50dma signal maynot be considered 
a.80- Alpha: Watchlist- below pivot-price are not considered as a buy [ARRS 4/27/2015]
a.81- Alpha: if base breakout was not a newhigh then recent-new-high OR gap-ups will be fine to be considered a good signal. <No symbol in particular>
    - Changed stop-loss Hard to -6.5% and soft to -4.5% (previously it was -7% and -5% respectively) <no symbol in particular>
    - Changed numOfPositionsOpentoBuy in downtrend to 0.25 * minNumOfPositionsOpenToBuy (previously it was 0.5 * minNumOfPositionsOpenToBuy ie., same as cautious uptrend) <No symbol in particular>
a.82- added maxInvestedPercent based on market-condition (Uptrend=100, CautiousUptrend=66% and Downtred=33%
a.83- Changed a.82 maxInvestedPercent based on market-condition Uptrend=150, CautiousUptrend=70% and Downtred=40% [previously see a.82]
a.84- Changed a.82 maxInvestedPercent based on market-condition Uptrend=150, CautiousUptrend=60% and Downtred=25% [previously see a.83]
a.85- Undid a.81: Changed stop-loss Hard to -7% and soft to -5% (previously it was -6.5% and -4.5% respectively)
    - fixed a bug in secondary-buy: was incorrectly using 20dema instead of 50dsma for 50ema secondary buy check
a.86- reworked a.51 logic for secondary buys on moving-averages
          uptrend: check for 10ema means pct-chg >= 7, 20ema >= 5 & 50sma >= 3
          cautious-uptrend: check for 20ema means pct-chg >= 6 & 50sma >= 4
          downtrend: check for 50sma means >= 5
      (this was done to make the buying in uptrend more aggressive.. although underperforming sells needs to be fixed as noted in a.5.1 comments)
      [previous values see a.51 - checks to 10EMA secondary buys to have min %chg of 9.5%, 20EMA to be 7.0% and 50ma  buys to be 4.5% (this avoid secondary sells as a result of AMBA,SCI and SBUX on pullbacks)]
    - also changed restriction for overall-pct-chg for secondary buy to be > 3% and pct-chg-from-last-buy > 2 (previously it was 5% and pct-chg-from-last-buy > 2.5)
    - also changed 10/20/50ma breakouts to be <=1.5% (previous it was 1.25)

a.87- adjusted secondary sell logic: must be < -0.75 to be considered a underperformer (previous < -0.5)
    - added condition to secondary sell logic to check for 50sma < -0.75 to be considered  a underperformer (previously none)
    - underperformance sell adjustment: added 0.5% increments starting from 0% @ 15d for every additional 5d from first-date [SBUX-5/1/2015]
      <10d ignore, <15d >0%, <30d >1%, <45d >2%, <60d >3%, <75d >4%, <90d >5%, <105d >6%, <120 >7%, <135 >8%, <150 >9%,, >=150 >10%
a.88- secondary buy logic: made overall-pct-chg and pct-chg-since-last-buy to be market-direction specific
      uptrend- overall-pct-chg > 3 and pct-chg-since-last-buy > 1
      cautious-uptrend- overall-pct-chg > 2.5 and pct-chg-since-last-buy > 1.5
      downtrend- overall-pct-chg > 5 and pct-chg-since-last-buy > 2
      [This makes the secondary buys aggressive in uptrend] (previously it was flat 3% and 2% respectively for pct-chg and pct-chg-from-last-buy - see a.86 for corresponding change)
a.89- added initial implementation of margin (50% margin)
    - numOfPositionsOpenToBuy: when margin allowed is reduced by 1 during uptrend.
a.90- bug in calculating the numOfPositionsOpentoBuy when margin is allowed.
      (removed the min-positions to buy logic in favor or max-pct-invested logic)
a.91- Changed a.82 maxInvestedPercent based on market-condition Uptrend=150, CautiousUptrend=75% and Downtred=30% [previously see a.84]
a.92/93- Testing with margin = 30% (previously it was 50%)
a.94/95- reverted a.92/93.. margin now 50%
    - Testing with maxPositions = 4 (previously 5)
a.96[BAD]- ActOnMarketSell: Uses 20ema/10ema when 50sma is not available (happens for recent IPOs such as TWTR Jan-2014).
    - Alpha: removed the concept of weak-signals
    - Alpha: prepares watchlists 15 days ahead of startdate
a.99[BAD]- Aplha: testing with vol-rate >= 200 (prev 150) and buy-range <7% (prev 5%)
a.100[BAD]- Alpha: made closing range < 50 on breakout-day will go to watchlist (previously 40) [CLDX Nob 2014]
     - Alpha: changed market cap to 1B (previously 750M) [avoids NVDQ in Jan 2014]
     - Alpha: added logic to ignore breakouts that doesnt close to new high (handle breakouts are ignored) Jul 2014, DEPO Aug 2014]
a.101- MarketSells - Dont sell on market-timing (eg., market in downtrend & cautious-up) if stock is still above 20ema by -0.5% [SNCR-Aug-2014 & SNCR Aug-2013]
     - Bug in unprocessed signals not added to watchlists
a.102- 

TODO: 
 - add partial sell logic
 - add RSI to alpha model.
 - need checks before buying to make sure we are not buying same security (eg., class-b shares)
 - need checks before buying to make sure we are not over-exposed to a sector/industry-group
